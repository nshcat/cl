- allow coloured strings in diagnostics messages. Find a good format for that (maybe printf style?)
- there needs to be a function to filter out the colour tags to allow colourless output.
- use "^x"!   ^0 is reset, ^1 dark bla, ^a bright...
- Diagnostics for commands! "git pusc" shows a message: "did you mean \"git push\"". This could very easily be done in libcl!
